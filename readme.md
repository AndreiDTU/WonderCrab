# About

This is a WonderSwan emulator I coded in Rust as an exercise, it is not very accurate and has very poor framerates.
Only some commercial games are capable or running at a playable framerate and with no major glitches.
This project might be of interest to people working on similar projects, or as a base for a more accurate and better optimized emulator.
